# public_api_repo
This Android application fetches Chuck Norris jokes from an API using Retrofit and displays them in the main activity, allowing users to refresh the content with a swipe gesture.


MainActivity: This is the main screen of the app. It sets up the user interface and handles user interactions. When the app starts, it initializes the UI using data binding and sets up a connection to the Chuck Norris jokes API via Retrofit. It also initializes a ViewModel to handle data operations and display the jokes.

MainActViewModel: This component is responsible for managing the data for the main activity. It communicates with the Chuck Norris jokes API through the repository, and it exposes the jokes to the UI. The ViewModel uses coroutines to perform network operations in the background, ensuring the app remains responsive.

MainRepository: The repository acts as an intermediary between the ViewModel and the Chuck Norris jokes API. It makes use of Retrofit to fetch a random joke from the API. If there's an issue with the API call, it gracefully handles exceptions.

RetrofitClient: This object sets up the Retrofit instance for making API requests. It defines the base URL, configures logging, and creates the necessary HTTP client. This client is used by the repository to communicate with the Chuck Norris jokes API.

APIManager: This is an interface that defines the API endpoints. In this case, there's a single endpoint for getting a random Chuck Norris joke. The Retrofit client uses this interface to create a concrete implementation for making network requests.

Data Class: This simple data class defines the structure of a Chuck Norris joke. It consists of fields like the joke's ID and content.
